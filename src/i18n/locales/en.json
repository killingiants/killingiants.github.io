That is, whenever the user enters a text in the text box, it is passed into the marked function from the marked library which compiles the markdown into HTML and the computed property re-renders it to our app instantly as it changes. So the next thing we want to do is render this markdown in our project and it is very straight forward or rather very simple to do so in Vue. We will add this line of code below to our template to create a text box where we can enter text. Recall we mentioned that the text will be passed to the function created inside the computed property."
